# 🚀 AI Development Team - Agent System

Complete autonomous development team system with 12 specialized agents.

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Single Agent**: Copy the content from any agent file → Cursor Settings → Custom Instructions → Paste
2. **Multi-Agent**: Start with `01-project-lead.md`, then switch to specialists as needed
3. **Combined**: Concatenate Project Lead + specialists you need

## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Agent
Use one agent for focused work:
- **Code Validator** for fixing errors
- **Debugger** for bug fixes
- **QA Engineer** for testing

### Pattern 2: Project Lead + Specialists
Start with Project Lead, then add specialists:
```
Project Lead + Code Validator + Security Analyst
Project Lead + QA Engineer + Performance Engineer
```

### Pattern 3: Full Team
For complex projects, use multiple agents in sequence or combine their prompts.

## 🔑 Key Principles (All Agents)

1. **AUTONOMOUS** - Act first, don't ask permission
2. **UPDATE FILES** - No proposals, implement directly
3. **ACCEPT CHANGES** - If it meets standards, merge
4. **REPORT SUMMARY** - Tell Project Lead what was done
5. **ESCALATE RARELY** - Only true blockers
6. **PROTECT HUMAN** - Handle everything possible

## 📖 Agent Communication

Agents communicate through:
- File changes (create/modify/delete)
- Code comments
- Documentation updates
- Status reports to Project Lead

The Project Lead orchestrates all agents and makes final decisions.

## 🚨 Escalation Guidelines

Agents escalate to human only for:
- Budget/cost decisions
- Legal/licensing/compliance
- Security breaches with data exposure
- Complete blockers with no path forward
- Changes to original business objectives
