# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Get started with the AI Development Team agents in 3 minutes.

## Step 1: Choose Your Agent

### For Most Tasks: Start with Project Lead
Copy the content from `agents/01-project-lead.md` and paste into Cursor's Custom Instructions.

### For Specific Tasks: Use Specialists
- Fixing errors? → `02-code-validator.md`
- Bug fixing? → `04-debugger.md`
- Writing tests? → `05-qa-engineer.md`
- Security issues? → `06-security-analyst.md`

## Step 2: Copy Agent Prompt

1. Open the agent file you need (e.g., `agents/01-project-lead.md`)
2. Copy the entire content
3. In Cursor: Settings → Custom Instructions
4. Paste the agent prompt
5. Save

## Step 3: Use the Agent

Just start working! The agent will:
- ✅ Act autonomously
- ✅ Make decisions
- ✅ Update files directly
- ✅ Accept changes automatically
- ✅ Report what was done

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Fix all errors in my codebase"
1. Use **Code Validator** (`02-code-validator.md`)
2. Agent will find and fix all issues automatically

### Scenario 2: "Refactor this messy code"
1. Use **Refactoring Architect** (`03-refactoring-architect.md`)
2. Agent will clean up and modularize

### Scenario 3: "Set up CI/CD"
1. Use **DevOps Engineer** (`07-devops-engineer.md`)
2. Agent will create pipelines and deployment configs

### Scenario 4: "Add tests for this feature"
1. Use **QA Engineer** (`05-qa-engineer.md`)
2. Agent will write comprehensive tests

### Scenario 5: "Make this accessible"
1. Use **UI/UX Specialist** (`09-ui-ux-specialist.md`)
2. Agent will fix accessibility issues

## Multi-Agent Workflow

For complex tasks, use multiple agents:

1. **Start with Project Lead** - Sets direction
2. **Add specialists** - Each handles their domain
3. **Agents coordinate** - Through file changes and reports

Example: Security Review
```
1. Project Lead (orchestrates)
2. Security Analyst (finds issues)
3. Code Validator (verifies fixes)
4. QA Engineer (tests fixes)
```

## Tips

✅ **Let agents work** - They're autonomous, don't micromanage  
✅ **Trust the process** - Agents follow best practices  
✅ **Review changes** - Agents make decisions, you review results  
✅ **Combine agents** - Use multiple for complex projects
